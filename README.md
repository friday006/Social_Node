# MERN Social Media Application

Welcome to the MERN Social Media Application repository! This project encompasses the creation of a full-fledged social media application using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. With this application, users can engage in various social activities such as posting, liking, following/unfollowing other users, and more.

## Overview

This project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Node.js Express Social Media REST API**: In the first part of the project, we developed a robust REST API using Node.js and Express.js. This API handles various functionalities such as user authentication (registering and logging in), CRUD operations for users and posts, following/unfollowing users, and more. MongoDB is used as the database to store user and post data.

2. **React Social Media Frontend**: In the second part, we created a captivating React frontend for our social media application. This frontend allows users to view posts, like/dislike them, create new posts, navigate through different pages such as the home page and profile page, and interact with other users' profiles.

3. **Integration of Backend and Frontend**: In the final part of the project, we integrate both the backend and frontend to create a complete social media application. This integration involves connecting the React frontend with the Node.js Express REST API to enable seamless communication between the client and server.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup Backend**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file to set up and run the Node.js Express Social Media REST API.

3. **Setup Frontend**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file to set up and run the React Social Media Frontend.

4. **Integration**: Once both the backend and frontend are set up and running, integrate them by configuring the frontend to make API requests to the backend endpoints.

## Project Structure
